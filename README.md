# Pewlet-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview

Our initital analysis analysis of Pewlett-Packard was astonoshing, we found that a vast number of their employees were soon due to retire. Using SQL we were able to combine the extracted employee tables into a database, this revealed a completed view of Pewlett-Hackards current employees slated to retire. Using our initial analysis, we were able to isolate the individuals who were approaching retirement soon. 

The new table generated has enabled us to be better prepared for the "Silver Tsunami", by setting a plan in motion to provide a mentorship program where the employees slated to retire can train those stepping up.

In my challenge, I am tasked with digging deeper into this idea of a mentorship program. In order to further analyze this idea of a mentorship program, I need to do further analysis on the titles of the employees slated to retire, as well as their eligibility to participate in this program.
